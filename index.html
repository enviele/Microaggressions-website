    <p class=descrip>
        This is a page to inform people about microaggressions. The focus is
        mainly on microaggressions on college campuses to emphasize that these
        events are not exclusive to non-college settings. Although colleges and
        unversities are portrayed as progressive and welcoming environments,
        these situations are still present on campuses because these are
        settings that include people of varying exposure to diversity. As much
        as high levels of diversity are advertised to the public, it's the lack
        of true diversity that is the main reason for the rise of these
        incidents that marginalized group of students experience. This website
        is meant to give insight into what different college students have
        experienced even within this advertised safe environment.
