    <p class=question>Q: Have you ever personally experience any form of microaggressions?</p>
    <p class=comment>For this question, everyone answered yes and had at least one example.</p>
    <p class=answer>“You don’t look like a normal Filipino girl.” “Your eyes are really small for a Filipino person.”
      “People ask if I’m adopted because of my last name. They think it’s pronounced Meyer.”
    </p>
    <p class=que>Anne Mier</p>
    <p class=comment>The marginalized group she was stereotyped with was Filipino women and
      she was usually targeted by White males.</p>

    <p class=answer>“Because of my skin color, they always ask where I am from.”
      “I don’t take it as a big deal thing.”</p>
      <p class=que>Grace Murekatete</p>
      <p class=que>WSU</p>
      <p class=que>Female</p>
      <p class=que>African American (Rwanda)</p>
    <p class=comment>Because of her accent as well she is asked for nationality, but she does not take offense since she is not from the United States,
      to her it is a valid question.</p>

    <p class=answer>“Everything is in relation to being a woman in a field where they are not welcome or common [Referring to Computer Science].”
      “I would say that STEM is predominantly White male.
      It’s very exclusive group of fields [when referring to engineering and STEM].”
      “The first one was when I was at a TA introductory meeting as a Computer Science 121 TA.
      We were going around the room and talking about hobbies. And people were guessing hobbies of other people for fun.
      To get to know everyone. A male TA turned to me and said ‘Housekeeping? Cooking? Cleaning?’. I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t respond. I was a bit shell shocked.
      The professor said we were moving on and we weren’t going to be guessing anymore.”
      When asked who were the usual people to target her she responded with: “Other men in computer science… making backhanded remarks. Not exclusive to race.”.
    </p>
    <p class=que>Elizabeth Viele</p>
    <p class=comment>The marginalized group she is being stereotyped with are women in STEM.</p>

    <p class=answer>“Sure, because I have a female body. I have had my intelligence doubted.
      I get complimented based on comparison to other girls… Men, predominantly White are the ones who usually make the comments.
      I have been hearing this since childhood and even since then I didn’t like it.
      It wasn’t until I became older that I realized there was a name for it.”</p>
    <p class=que>Danny</p>
    <p class=comment>The marginalized group she is stereotyped with is women.</p>

    <p class=answer>“Why do you want to go into politics?” “I’m surprised you’re so interested in this, since you’re a woman.” “
      You’re just doing it [political science major] because it’s the easier major.”
      “It’s not practical to get a political science degree… just do business.”
    </p>
    <p class=que>Jordan Smith</p>
    <p class=comment>At work the women are asked to do simpler, less labor intensive tasks.
      These comments are usually made by White males in her major ever since she decided to go into
      the field her Sophomore year in high school.
      The marginalized group she is stereotyped with is women.
    </p>

    <p class=answer>“I got my hair relaxed when I was fifteen and this boy, I remember it happened at school in the computer lab, said about my hair,
      ‘I like your other hair better [referring to unrelaxed hair]’ and ‘Why did you do that to your hair?’”
      “Most comments are targeting the African American side of me.”
    </p>
    <p class=que>Kaylee Phillips</p>
    <p class=comment>The marginalized group she is stereotyped with is African American women. She also mentioned that it was usually male
      friends of hers who would make those comments.
    </p>

    <p class=answer>“When people meet me sometimes I get a “You’re cool cus you don’t ‘act black’.” “Once everyone finds out I’m African and not Black, then everyone, no matter who, treats me differently.”
      “I was once referred to as a suspicious character at my own work by a woman customer.”
    </p>
    <p class=que>Anonymous</p>

    <p class=question>Q: Have you ever spoken out against a microaggression? (personal or not)</p>

    <p class=answer>“No because I take it as giving information to someone. I’m actually supporting it.”</p>
    <p class=que>Grace Murekatete</p>

    <p class=answer>“I’m not an argumentative person. I don’t like confrontation. I just kinda let things happen. It’s not my personality. Some of it comes from being a minority.”</p>
    <p class=que>Kaylee Phillips</p>

    <p class=answer>“No. Probably because I am foreign.”</p>
    <p class=que>Anonymous</p>

    <p class=answer>“I defend the major and why it’s important to have more women in politics. If it’s happening near me then I intervene. I might say, ‘Why would you say that?’ or ‘That’s not something you say to people.’ I speak out because it’s wrong what they’re saying.
      It’s not right for them to do.”
    </p>
    <p class=que>Jordan Smith</p>

    <p class=answer>“My dad once said “Have you noticed how Black people have really white teeth.” Because he thinks it’s okay. I called him out because it’s not good to generalize anyone. If they don’t fit into that type then something is ‘wrong’.”</p>
    <p class=que>Anne Mier</p>

    <p class=answer>“I wish every time that it happens…I haven’t because I don’t want to start something I don’t want to be THAT person. Especially when it relates to my job.
      If I said anything, I feel like it would get worse. At school they taught you don’t be a bystander. I want to protect them from that, cus I know what it feels like
      and I know how it’s shitty, but when it’s against me I know that I can deal with it.”

    <p class=question>Q: After this conversation, do you think you will be more aware of microaggressions in your life? Do you think you will be more comfortable speaking out against them?</p>
    <p class=comment>This question was asked after having a conversation of ideas on how to fight against microaggressions and why it’s important to say something.</p>

    <p class=answer>“I already knew what they were, but now I know a better definition. I didn’t know it included insults. I thought they were just questions that are meant to be innocent but are backhanded.” “I think so. I want to [in response to second question].”</p>
    <p class=que>Elizabeth Viele</p>

    <p class=answer>“I think I’ll always be coming more and more aware. Always trying to get better at it.”</p>
    <p class=que>Danny</p>

    <p class=answer>“I have personally experienced it my whole life because I am a woman. People tend to stay more quiet in college in comparison to high school but also more people speak out against strangers. Personally,
      the chances of speaking out haven’t changed since high school.”
    </p>
    <p class=que>Jordan Smith</p>

    <p class=answer>“I think I have the same awareness. With age comes more ‘no shits given’”.</p>
    <p class=que>Anonymous</p>

    <p class=answer>“I don’t think I would feel comfortable.”</p>
    <p class=que>Grace Murekatete</p>

    <p class=answer>“It’s never going to be comfortable. I’m always gonna be shy.”</p>
