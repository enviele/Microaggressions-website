        This website is meant to connect others with local and national resources to
        empower them to be proactive and take small, actionable steps that can and
        will accumulate into meaningful change. Regardless of political affiliation,
        regardless of who is in office, we need to make a commitment to civic engagement
        and keep those in power accountable by advocating for the quality of life, rights,
        and liberties of not only ourselves but of others as well.

        This is especially true, in light of an administration which is willing to lie about
        something as blatantly obvious as the inauguration turn out, and has an unprecedented
        lack of transparency with the media ---  Donate to charities and nonprofits doing
        incredible and important work on the front lines in your community and throughout
        the country. Call your representative(s), who know they are responsible for and will
        seriously take into consideration the wants and needs of their constituents.
      </p>

        It’s the little things --- a lot of little things, that make all the difference.

        Politics are more polarized than ever, but you can reverse this course of action by
        refusing to be blindly beholden to a particular political party. Keep up with the news,
        form an educated political opinion. Make an effort to understand and engage in constructive
        discourse with those who share different values than you do. But call out BS as you see it.
        That you or another group of people don’t deserve the rights and liberties afforded to the
        majority of others is not a political opinion. Remind yourself of this. Remind others of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stand up for members of vulnerable communities as their safety and rights are put in harm’s way.
        For many people, the political process is less about a game of ideological chess and more of
        something that has a direct impact on their day to day lives. Which is why this should matter to you,
        and you should actually do something about it.
