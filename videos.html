    <!--Mosquito Bites explanation --->
    <p class=descrip>This is a very simplified but accurate representation of what microaggressions are like for people who experience them on the daily.
      It may seem like an overreaction to an outsider who is just tuning in to the last straw when in reality it’s the accumulation of the everyday
      slights and comments that result in that reaction. Minorities are taught to simply ignore or move on because it’s not that big of a deal.
      This video explores why microaggressions are such an important topic to discuss.</p>

    <!-- Interview video explanation-->
    <p class=descrip>This is an interview with Dr. Sue who provided the definition of microaggressions that I gave to all the people
      I interviewed. He explains how commenting on someone’s ability to speak English is so harmful and backhanded. He takes apart the comment
      to unfold by exactly that is a charged remark that holds so much condescendence and should be gotten rid of.</p>
